# CODECART: BARCODE ENABLED APPLICATION FOR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT

Shopping on busy weekends always seems like a tiresome process. A long wait in the checkout line adds to the hassles in the existing traditional approach of shopping. Many supermarkets currently use the purchasing approach to scan all the items picked by the customer with the use of a barcode scanner. This proposed system optimizes the user’s shopping experience. We introduce CodeCart- a software application with integrated barcode scanning. The customers will scan the barcode of the products they need and it will get added to the cart. This will help to mitigate the scanning time of the items and thus provide good service to the customers. The system also includes a web based application which is an Inventory Management System for the retailer, having access to the entire system and database. A Point of Sales-based inventory management system offers a powerful solution to the challenges associated with traditional inventory management practices. After scanning the required items, the user can proceed for swift payment, and an automated billing number will be generated having all the transaction details. The primary objective is to streamline the entire purchasing process right from shopping to checkout. Thus, the proposed system aims to streamline the entire purchase experience for the customers and retailers
